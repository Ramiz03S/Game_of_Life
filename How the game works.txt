The game is called a zero-player game, you only input the initial state of the system and you watch as it evolves on its own after that.
The game is made up of a grid of cells and they can either be dead or alive.
The state of a cell after the initial state is determined by the state of the cells that neighbor it via a set of specified rules: 
1.	Any live cell with less than two live neighbors dies in the next iteration. 
2.	Any live cell with two or three live neighbors stays alive in the next iteration. 
3.	Any live cell with more than three neighbors dies in the next iteration.
4.	Any dead cell with exactly three neighbors, becomes alive in the next iteration.
Initially, all cells would be dead, then via the start playing menu you can control what happens next.
