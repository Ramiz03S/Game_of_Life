To start playing enter 3(type 3 then press enter)
Then you are given the choice of manually choosing the cells you want to be alive initially
or choosing from samples I made.
If you enter 1: 
  you will then be asked to choose the number of rows and columns of your grid
  enter them in X,X format where X is a positive integer greater than 3,
  skip this step by entering zero and choosing a default of 10,10.
  you will then be asked to input the coordinates of the alive cells.
  Do so by entering X,Y where X and Y and positive integers, and repeat till you're done, then enter 0.
  Keep in mind, a grid of 5,5 for examples, will have rows and columns indexed from 0 to 4, so do NOT enter cell coordinates that exceed 4.
  After that, keep entering 1 to see the grid of cells change(or not) with each iteration. Then, enter 2 to go back to the main menu.
  Or you can enter 3, to save the current grid you see on the screen to a file which can be used in section 2.
If you enter 2:
  enter the number of the option you want to select,
  After that, keep entering 1 to see the grid of cells change(or not) with each iteration.
  Then, enter 2 to go back to the main menu.

Enter 1 now to go back to the main menu.
